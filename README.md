# 👨‍💻 Python OOP Concepts – My Assignment Collection

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to my Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) assignment repository. This collection contains practical examples of **21 core OOP topics**, written in simple and beginner-friendly Python code.

These assignments helped me deeply understand how OOP works in Python—from basic concepts like `self` and constructors, to more advanced ideas like decorators, custom exceptions, and multiple inheritance.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

Here’s a quick look at all the topics I’ve covered:

### ✅ Basics
1. **Using `self`** — Initialize and access instance attributes with a `Student` class.  
2. **Using `cls`** — Track object creation with class method in a `Counter` class.  
3. **Public Variables and Methods** — Use public data and functions from a `Car` class.  
4. **Class Variables & Methods** — Share and modify `bank_name` using the `Bank` class.  
5. **Static Methods** — Perform operations without any instance using `MathUtils.add()`.

### 🧱 Core OOP Building Blocks
6. **Constructors & Destructors** — Log messages on creation/destruction in a `Logger`.  
7. **Access Modifiers** — Explore `public`, `protected`, and `private` in `Employee`.  
8. **The `super()` Function** — Use inheritance properly with `Person` and `Teacher`.  
9. **Abstract Classes** — Force method implementation in a `Rectangle` via `Shape`.  
10. **Instance Methods** — Add behavior to objects with `Dog.bark()`.

# 🧠 Class-level Thinking
11. **Class Methods** — Count books with `Book.increment_book_count()`.  
12. **Static Methods** — Convert temperature using a stateless utility method.  
13. **Composition** — Build a `Car` using an `Engine` (has-a relationship).  
14. **Aggregation** — Link `Department` and `Employee` (lives independently).  
15. **MRO & Diamond Inheritance** — Explore method resolution in class `D`.

# ✨ Advanced Python Magic
16. **Function Decorators** — Log when a function is called with a custom decorator.  
17. **Class Decorators** — Add a `greet()` method to any class dynamically.  
18. **Property Decorators** — Manage private attributes with `@property` and friends.  
19. **`__call__()` & `callable()`** — Call an object like a function with `Multiplier`.  
20. **Custom Exceptions** — Raise `InvalidAgeError` when age is below 18.  
21. **Custom Iterable** — Loop over a `Countdown` class using `__iter__()`.
